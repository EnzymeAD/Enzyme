# Enzyme Overview

The Enzyme project is a tool that takes arbitrary existing code as LLVM IR and computes the derivative (and gradient) of that function. This allows developers to use Enzyme to automatically create gradients of their source code without much additional work. By working at the LLVM level Enzyme is able to differentiate programs in a variety of languages (C, C++, Swift, Julia, Rust, Fortran, TensorFlow, etc) in a single tool and achieve high performance by integrating with LLVM's optimization pipeline.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

double square(double x) {
    return x * x;
}

double __enzyme_autodiff(void*, double);
int main() {
    double x = 3.14;
    // Evaluates to 2 * x = 6.28
    double grad_x = __enzyme_autodiff((void*)square, x);
    printf("square'(%f) = %f\n", x,  grad_x);
}
```

By differentiating code after optimization, Enzyme is able to create substantially faster derivatives than existing tools that differentiate programs before optimization.

## Components

Enzyme is composed of four pieces:

*   An optional preprocessing phase which performs minor transformations that tend to be helpful for AD.
*   A new interprocedural type analysis that deduces the underlying types of memory locations
*   An activity analaysis that determines what instructions or values can impact the derivative computation (common in existing AD systems).
*   An optimization pass which creates any required derivative functions, replacing calls to `__enzyme_autodiff` with the generated functions.
