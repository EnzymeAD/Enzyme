Enzyme can be used to differentiate any langauge which compiles to LLVM (C/C++, Rust, Swift, Julia, Fortran, Tensorflow, etc).
We currently offer extra support (documentation, nice wrappers, package-manger integration, etc) for some of them.

Plase see the [C/C++](/Installation/C++) guide for information on how to set everything up for C and C++.

Plase see the [Julia](/Installation/Julia) guide for information on how to set everything up for Julia.

Plase see the [Rust](/Installation/Rust) guide for information on how to set everything up for Rust.

If your language currently has no specific documentation, we recommend to just start with the C++ setup.
Afterwards, please feel free to make a PR against the `www` branch and add information, we always welcome new contributions!
